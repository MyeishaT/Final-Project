          <h1>What does LGBTQIA+ mean?</h1>
          <p>LGTBQIA+ Means<br>
            The acronym LGBTQIA+ is an ever growing and evolving acronym. It is an inclusive term covering people of all genders and sexualities, such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, queer, intersex, asexual, pansexual, and allies. Since this is not one group but several different groups, itâ€™s important to examine what each different letter stands for and most importantly take a look at how it will make others feel.</p>
              
              <h1>L (Lesbian)</h1>
          <p>What Does Lesbian Mean?<br>
            A lesbian is a female homosexual: a female who experiences romantic love or sexual attraction to other females.</p>
              
              <h1>G (Gay)</h1>
          <p>What Does Gay Mean?<br>
            Gay is a term that primarily refers to a homosexual person or the trait of being homosexual. Gay is often used to describe homosexual males but lesbians may also be referred to as gay.</p>
              
              <h1>B (Bisexual)</h1>
          <p>What Does Bisexual Mean?<br>
            Bisexuality is romantic attraction, sexual attraction or sexual behavior toward both males and females, or romantic or sexual attraction to people of any sex or gender identity; this latter aspect is sometimes termed pansexuality.</p>
              
              <h1>T (Transgender)</h1>
          <p>What Does Trangender Mean?<br>
            Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity differs from what is typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. It is sometimes abbreviated to trans.</p>
              
              <h1>Q (Queer)</h1>
          <p>What Does Queer Mean?<br>
            Queer is an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual or cisgender. Queer was originally used pejoratively against those with same-sex desires but, beginning in the late-1980s, queer scholars and activists began to reclaim the word.</p>
              
              <h1>I (Intersex)</h1>
          <p>What Does Intersex Mean?<br>
            Intersex is a variation in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, or genitals that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female.</p>
              
              <h1>A (Asexual)</h1>
          <p>What Does Asexual Mean?<br>
            Asexuality (or nonsexuality) is the lack of sexual attraction to anyone, or low or absent interest in sexual activity. It may be considered the lack of a sexual orientation, or one of the variations thereof, alongside heterosexuality, homosexuality, and bisexuality.</p>
